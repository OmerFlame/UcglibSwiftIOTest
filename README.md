README from the zip archive:

Inconsolata is one of the most suitable font for programmers created by Raph Levien. Since the original Inconsolata does not contain Cyrillic alphabet, it was slightly inconvenient for not a few programmers from Russia.

Inconsolata LGC is a modified version of Inconsolata with added the Cyrillic alphabet which directly descends from Inconsolata Hellenic supporting modern Greek.

Inconsolata LGC is licensed under SIL OFL.
